Dear Sir or Madam,

% [Paragraphe d’introduction]
% I will graduate from CentraleSupélec this year, while also holding a double degree with the Research Master's in Applied Fundamental Mathematics from the University of Lorraine. My specialization focuses on artificial intelligence, and more specifically on its applications in computer vision. I would therefore like to join your team for the position of \postName, in order to actively contribute to your projects in artificial intelligence and data processing.
% Graduating this year from CentraleSupélec with a double degree in Research Master's in Applied Fundamental Mathematics (University of Lorraine), I am eager to join your R\&D teams as a Data Scientist. My background combines rigorous training in applied mathematics with significant practical experience in artificial intelligence and computer vision.
Graduating this year from CentraleSupélec with a Research Master's in Applied Fundamental Mathematics, I am applying to join your teams as a Data Scientist. My profile combines advanced mathematical expertise and practical experience in applied artificial intelligence.

% [Intérêt pour le poste]
% The position of \postName\ particularly interests me as it matches both my skills and areas of interest, notably in artificial intelligence and data processing. I am motivated by the idea of contributing to concrete projects with real impact, while continuing to learn and grow. Working within your team represents for me an excellent opportunity to put my knowledge into practice in a stimulating and collaborative environment.
% Dassault Systèmes attracts me by its unique positioning at the intersection of advanced mathematics and industrial innovation. Your approach to numerical simulation and digital twin technology, particularly in aerospace and automotive, resonates perfectly with my passion for complex technical challenges and concrete applications of research.
Decartes Underwriting inspires me with its revolutionary approach to parametric insurance, where rigorous mathematical modeling and technological innovation combine to address contemporary climate challenges. Your ability to transform complex data into concrete risk management solutions aligns perfectly with my vision of the positive impact of applied mathematics.

% [Spécificité entreprise]

% [Pourquoi moi ?]
% Thanks to my engineering training at CentraleSupélec, complemented by a research master's in applied fundamental mathematics, I have acquired strong foundations in mathematics, programming, and artificial intelligence. My journey has enabled me to develop a rigorous, analytical, and problem-solving-oriented mindset. I am autonomous, curious, and I enjoy learning through practice as well as reading specialized works in statistics and AI. My interest in this field is reflected in various personal and academic projects, notably in computer vision, a subject I would be happy to expand on during an interview. I am also comfortable with modern development tools (Python, Git, Docker, etc.), which allows me to quickly integrate into a technical environment.
% My experience at Michelin (metal artifact reduction via deep learning on tomographic images) and at EDF (turbine failure classification with CamemBERT fine-tuning) illustrates my ability to apply cutting-edge models to real industrial challenges. My personal project "Machine Learning Grind" demonstrates my passion for research: I implement classical architectures from scratch (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet, ResNet) and train them on ImageNet-100, showcasing a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations of deep learning.
My recent experiences demonstrate this approach: at Michelin, I developed diffusion models for artifact reduction on tomographic images; at EDF, I fine-tuned CamemBERT for automatic classification of industrial failures. In parallel, my "Machine Learning Grind" project reflects my passion for fundamental research: I implement reference architectures from scratch and explore their theoretical foundations, cultivating a deep understanding of learning mechanisms.

% [Compétences]
% Throughout my journey, I have developed solid skills in applied mathematics, notably in advanced probability and statistics, optimization, as well as machine learning. I consolidated these skills through my research master's in applied fundamental mathematics and my final-year specialization at CentraleSupélec in data and information science. I master the main machine learning and deep learning frameworks (Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as data processing libraries and tools (pandas, NumPy). I am also comfortable with modern development environments (Git, Docker, Conda), which allows me to quickly integrate into concrete and technical projects. My personal project Machine Learning Grind, which I maintain on GitHub, reflects my deep commitment to understanding and experimenting with AI models.
% My dual training allows me to combine theoretical rigor with technical pragmatism, essential skills to contribute to your R\&D projects in applied artificial intelligence for engineering.
My background in stochastic processes and advanced probability, coupled with this practical experience, positions me ideally to contribute to your climate risk models and to develop robust algorithms in uncertain contexts.

% [Conclusion]
% I would be pleased to discuss this opportunity with you. Of course, I remain at your disposal for any further information or interview. Thank you for the attention given to my application.
% I would be delighted to discuss this opportunity further and to present my work in more detail.
I would be enthusiastic to discuss your vision and my potential contributions to your projects.

Sincerely,
